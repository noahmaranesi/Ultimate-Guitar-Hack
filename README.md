# Ultimate Guitar Hack
Download any Guitar Pro file, including 'Official' and blocked/removed tabs


## Overview

This tool allows downloads on of the following interactive file from Ultimate Guitar:

- Official\*
- Blocked tabs\**
- Guitar Pro files
- Tab Pro
- Power Tab

\* = Although advertised as "Official", these tabs are made and by the Ultimate Guitar team. They are the same readable formats as modern Guitar Pro (`.gp`, `.gpx`).

\** = Tabs with [revoked licenses](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/ug_news/here_is_why_you_see_ads_and_dont_have_access_to_ratm_tabs.html) (more [below](#why-i-am-sharing-this)).

I copied the HTML from a Guitar Pro file that I was able to download and pasted it onto another tab, replaces some values, and now I'm able to download almost anything.

## Why I am sharing this

People take lots of valuable time wanting to help other musicians learn a song, for it only to be taken down due to "copyright", even though it's not a direct copy and it's ones own interruption of a song. The ~~artists~~ copyright holder/s that block tabs are my main motivation behind doing this. Some of these artists include: **Rage Against The Machine** (so much for being anti-corporation and anti-censorship), **Dethklok**, **David Bowie**, **Protest The Hero**, **Polyphia**, **August Burns Red**, **PUP**, **The Fall of Troy**, **Owl City** and plenty more.

As [EvandroJGC](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/u/EvandroJGC) said on an [Ultimate Guitar news post a few years ago](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/ug_news/thank_you_ug_community_you_helped_us_unblock_700_tabs_join_the_campaign_to_unblock_more.html#5139700):

> If the tab was made "by ear", without transcripting from a songbook, is [it] not allowed? This is in the tab rules of this site, right? Why these artirts *[sic]* would be against it? It's a free/amateur version. Right?
